          <p class="about-me"> I am dedicated to providing efficient solutions to complex problems. As I continue to grow and build relationships with people, I strive to develop and uplift myself to enrich the lives of people around me to create a promising future for the world and organizations.
              My motto and something I always tell myself is "Get work done on time, fast, and well done." I value the quality of work and always set my mind to being detailed oriented providing the best output. I believe in a culture of continuous learning and development, an environment that encourages innovation and experimentation.
              The unceasing advancement in technology will alter the core knowledge and skills individuals possess
              with the need to upgrade at every level, I always aspire to bring out the best result, be of great value, and continue to grow with an open mindset of consistent learning.
              Working at the Learning Factory at McMaster University has allowed me to gain experience in how an industry operates, build automated systems that improve production efficiency, develop skills in working with equipment like CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine), and implement Industry 4.0 to improve operations.
              I have had the opportunity to start a Smart Systems team where we integrate sensors, analyze data, and make decisions, implement Internet of Things (IoT) to optimize operations.

              Having been a research assistant at EcoCar has given me insight into the world of autonomous vehicles, I have been able to work with models like the physics and plant models to develop programs using Simulink and eliminate errors to build an efficient system that is best suitable for the environment.

              One of the great things about working in EcoCar is seeing how each subteam works efficiently to develop the best system that will create an autonomous vehicle. This has allowed me to build relationships and be positively influenced.

                    <p>  One  of the steps involved in the production of walking is to stain and spray the wood,<br>
                        this lead to creating a system that allows the three part wood to spin while changing <br>
                        the speed as desired, detect if the door is open and set the fan for drying,
                        while detecting desired <br> temperature in the system to determine if the fan is be switched off or on.<br>
                        Using Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) I was able to implement  these function. <br>
                        As seen in the picture on the right many alterations, implementations and testing of <br>different devices such as
                        initially using a stepper motor and switching to <br> DC  motor for better heat resistance,
                        adding relays to control the ON/OFF of the motors.
                       <br> For a better interaction of the machine a C-more EA9 series HMI is <br>used to control the speed and switch the system Off/On

                    One of the projects worked in the learning factory at McMaster University is the <br> water filter system.
                    Using activated charcoal(charcoal soaked in 25% salt water solution),
                    <br>to remove particles and chemicals present in water and an ultrafiltration which eliminates <br> any pathogens that is
                    virus and bacteria present in the water. In order to reduce cost and <br>enhance flexibility, a water filter was designed and
                    3D printed. The process of this system as <br>shown by the picture on the right is,  water goes into the filter, through activated charcoal,
                    <br>through cotton to remove charcoal residue and through a mesh.  The outlet of the<br> filter goes through an ultrafiltration (UV light), which
                    goes through a valve. <br> In order to monitor this system and ensure proper filtration, turbidity sensor was added <br> before filtration and after
                    filtration. A UV sensor was placed beside the UV light to <br>ensure it is ON when operating, and if not so the valve would close
                    preventing users from<br> consuming the water.

                    In production of walking cane in the learning factory at McMaster University, on of the steps <br>
                    taken is to glue brass couplers to the cane. In the process of doing so, there was an inconsistent <br>
                    amount of glue which has lead damage to some wooden cane parts, with some cane not strong enough <br>due
                    little adhesive dispensed into the cane parts. In order to eliminate this problem, a dispensing station <br>
                    was integrated. With a set amount of time programmed with PLC and displayed on thin client for users to interact
                    and produce, the dispensing station eliminates the issue of inconsistent use of adhesive in production and aids
                    to maintain quality.

                    A walking cane is as old as time but very little technology are implemented in it.
                    Working with the learning factory,  I started developing ways to make a cane smart.
                    The first step to this was understanding the production of a regular cane, I made
                    3D CAD models of prototype, added pressure sensor to the cane to read values of
                    how much force an individual is putting on the cane this will allow to know if
                    someone’s health condition is getting better or worse. Constant development
                    are made to produce a better product of cane hence a club under McMaster Bachelor
                    of Technology Association was formed. This allowed for sale of the product and
                    continuity of production of the smart walking cane.

                    Packaging is an important element for brand identity, but this is also a design
                    process that can easily get complicated. With many different alterations
                    of a custom box that will reduce cost but still effectively  display
                    the desired elements that stand for the product and the brand.
                    Worked with a graphic designer that interpreted the vision of the product
                    through the logo with the name of the brand called ‘SolidStep.’
                    As seen from the first upper picture a prototype of what the packaging is meant
                    to look was produced, following university polices a finial product was produced.
